### UTILITY SYSTEM

```shell
yarn install # initialize repo

yarn serve # serve this package indipendently (useful to test single ui components)

yarn build # build library (so that it can be used in other packages)

yarn start # build library and watch for changes (so that it can be used in other packages)

yarn sync:link # this will let you install this library in your other packages as an alias folder in node_modules (it only works when you have access both to this library and to the microfrontend at the same time)
```
